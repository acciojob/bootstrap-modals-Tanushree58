# Bootstrap Modals

 Rendering a new page all the time is not always the best user interface. To get the best user experience Modals are used instead of a new page each and every time. Designing a modal with proper animation and positioning from scratch is a bit hard. That's where Bootstrap 'Modals' makes frontend developer's life easier.
 
 In this assignment create a Bootstrap Modal that is displayed on a button click.
 <li>Button should have id = "open-modal"</li><li>Modal should have id = "accio-modal"</li><li>Modal should be Vertically centered</li><li>Modal header should have title **New Modal**</li><li>Modal body should have first paragraph of Lorem ipsum as its content.</li><li>Modal footer should have a close button to close the modal</li>
